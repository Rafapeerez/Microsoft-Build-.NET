This course tha I have started was free due to an agreement between universities, including the UCO. While I'm doing the course I upload everythin to GitHub separate by the differents modules of 
the course.

My first contact with Razor Pages and .NET has been with this course, for example in module4/ I cloned a repository to follow the instructions to start in the .NET world and update the views 
of an already created web application, that's why the reference to the repository.
In order to work with .NET, I decided that the best option (the one that would give me the least version headaches) would be to install "Dev Containers" for VSCode and 
launch a virtual environment with the default settings for the repository.
